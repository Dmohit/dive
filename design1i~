++++Data Structures for managing data projections++++
To begin, we need to show that all operations in the system ALWAYS require one data copy and and one false copy.
We shall also map out when it is necessary to deal with a projection (projection may be fixed).

Operation    Data    	  Oth 	  	       	 Data Projected?	Is Oth a projection?
Initialize   All     	  Unknown/permutation	 No   			No
Fixed Set    Some set	  Same as Data Set	 No			Yes
Target Set   Some set	  Some set (moved)	 No			Yes
Unfixed Set  Some set	  Unknown/permutation	 No			No

Thus we can see that the data and oth sets behave quite differently.
This leads us to our first design decision of using separate data structures for these two.
1. dset
   A dset stores row ids that point to the data. (In keeping with the idea that data should not be touched)
2. oset
   An oset stores a small oth set. (as it applies to the corresponding dset, see below)
   It further has a flag that indicates whether this is a projected set.
dsets and osets are atomic objects, and hence know nothing about each other or about their own purpose.

3. pair
   A pair is what brings dsets and osets together. Each pair is essentially a (dset,oset) pair.
   The only addition is a type attribute so that our sets become aware of the world around them.
   Also includes functions to sensibly manage the dsets and osets based on the type attribute.
   To do this latter task, reflect a bit on the above table.
      It is easy to infer that a dset must always be present, and is thus required at the time of intialization.
      An oset can constructed given a dset, and the type (not for all types though)
   Objective function and required parameters reside here
   All pairs reside within a single closure
   Overall the pair closure is fairly complicated, and so as far as possible, all higher functions should deal directly with pairs
   This will help in reducing errors
   Thus we must do away with an explicit "view" structure as envisaged in previous design iterations (view is now abstract)
   Since all pairs reside within a single closure, let us consider this closure can be considered to be the (notional) view
   A pair is unaware of the optimization process
   It only provides a numerical index value if provided a matrix

Operations on a list of pairs
   The idea is to minimize state variables, so that there are no closures here
   * New pair (type specified) from brush -> (Define new pair, initialize, reconcile all previously defined pairs)
   How to reconcile previously defined pairs
   There is some point set {x1,...xk} of type T0 and one of these (for simplicity) now moves over to a set of type T1
   There is never any challenge in defining the new pair of type T1
   T0	    T1	   	 Reconciliation
   unfixed  <any>	 remove points, and construct.o.from.d
   fixed    <any>	 Pass oth from data, projected=TRUE
   target   <any>	 Get Data, Decide which point to remove, get oth, remove from same
   Since what T1 is does not seem to matter, (T0 is known to pair function) this should be encapsulated in the pair function
   In fact, most of this can be made to flow from the data ids
   * New ggobi display / New view -> New universal pair
          (Handled by pair itself!)
   * Destroy pair -> de-reference from index vector
   * Define / evaluate (super) objective function
   * Optimize View
   * Binding any particular view to a display window or to a widget tab
   	   Responsibility of gui
   * Split Operation
   	 Composed of the following steps:
	 	  create new view structure
		  copy current cdata
		  get new name from gui
		  copy optim.hist structure upto position specified into new structure

In light of the foregoing, we are better able to define a view
   A view is a list of the following elements
   First Element : A list of pairs (cdata)
   Second Element : A vector of weights (to compose the objective function)
   Third Element : A list of projection matrices (optim.hist)
   Fourth Element : A 2-element string vector (name)
This implies
     That pair objects are transient in the sense that once their defintion changes, the old definition cannot be recovered
     Each step in the optimization does not force us to create a new pairs object

There are two things that (can) change
   Defintion of individual pair objects (though the universe remains fixed)
   Projection Matrices (dictating point configuration that are of primary interest)

==========================================

Since the data structures seem fine, let us now come to widget design
We list out widget design by operations
We are looking at a 2 window design
Window 1 is divided up into a number of tabs
   Each tab has a name that corresponds to a view name
   Each tab has a name that corresponds to a ggobi display window name
   The name is derived from the slot name (Xvar-Yvar)
   Lower half is information window displaying information about
   	 Brushed Groups : Colour, Number of observations, and If included in any pair (if any) and which
	 Current Projection Matrix
	 Steps from initial
	 Index Value
   Upper half is controls
   	 Brushed Group : radio Buttons (type) : weight
Window 2 is essentially a slot manager
   
====================================
The GGobi Manager
There is a duality when we come to the ggobi manager. What should it handle? Actually, the ggobi can handle two things.
      1. The full data (obviously we will need random tours to get a scatterplot display)
      2. The data projected onto a set of projection matrices
To do (1), we shall need to have a special slot for the data
This special slot shall need to be handled specially by the entire software
For now, we omit this feature, though we do need it!!!
Suppose we have only (2).
The ggobi handles a frame, which is nothing but the projections of the entire data, set in consecutive columns
To minimize states, the dataset is itself never stored in the ggobi manager
Though of course, it can always be obtained from the display
Thus we need a miscellaneous function to actually construct a frame and pass it on to ggobi

+++++
The frame constructor
One way to construct a frame is to just 
    pass the data (unevaluated string?)
    list of (projection) matrices (unevaluated string)
This is a simple way and is guranteed to work
The full frame is constructed only once
