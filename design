This is the design document for a system that allows the user to keep some points fixed and move some other points. The system then tries to find a projection that best matches the constraints. It is really a kind of projection pursuit.
+++++++++++Some terminology+++++++++++++++
Fixed Set	A set that the user wants should maintain its shape in the new projection
     	   	There can be multiple fixed sets
		Anything outside a fixed set can be called unfixed set. But we dont not need that word.
Target Set	A set of points that the user is manipulating right now 
       		May or may not be treated as the unfixed set in the objective function
Strength	Corresponding to each fixed set is a strength
The objective function is a convex combination of the fixed sets and the unfixed set (and the target set)
+++++++++++Fundamental components++++++++++++++++++
An interactive graphics device with the following features
   An arbitrary number of them can be open at the same time
   It allows the user to brush observations
   Brushed Observations are visible to R
   It allows the user to drag brushed observation(s) to another place
A cepp engine
A widget allowing interaction with the cepp engine
A widget backend
+++++++++Behaviour of the widget+++++++++++++++++++
Sliders		   Strength of Fixed Set i (i=1...k)
		   Number of Steps to find new projection
Buttons		   Open New (blank) Device
		   Clone Current Device
		   Make Current Selection into ith (i=1...k) fixed set
		   Find New Projection
		   Make current device for plotting
Radio Button	   Make ith (i=1...k) fixed set active / inactive
