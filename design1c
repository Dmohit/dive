This is the design document for a system that allows the user to keep some points fixed and move some other points. The system then tries to find a projection that best matches the constraints. It is really a kind of projection pursuit.
+++++++++++Some terminology+++++++++++++++
Fixed Set	A set that the user wants should maintain its shape in the new projection
     	   	There can be multiple fixed sets
		Anything outside a fixed set can be called unfixed set. But we dont not need that word.
Target Set	A set of points that the user is manipulating right now
       		May or may not be treated as the unfixed set in the objective function
Strength	Corresponding to each fixed set is a strength
The objective function is a convex combination of the fixed sets and the unfixed set (and the target set)
+++++++++++Fundamental components++++++++++++++++++
An interactive graphics device with the following features
   An arbitrary number of them can be open at the same time
   It allows the user to brush observations
   Brushed Observations are visible to R
   It allows the user to drag brushed observation(s) to another place
A cepp engine
A widget allowing interaction with the cepp engine
A widget backend
+++++++++Behaviour of the widget+++++++++++++++++++
Sliders		   Strength of Fixed Set i (i=1...k)
		   Number of Steps to find new projection
Buttons		   Open New (blank) Device
		   Clone Current Device
		   Make Current Selection into ith (i=1...k) fixed set
		   Find New Projection
		   Make current device for plotting
Radio Button	   Make ith (i=1...k) fixed set active / inactive
+++++++++Behaviour of the widget backend++++++++++++++++++
Set number of fixed sets via closures
Store fixed sets via closures
Create objective function
===============IMPLEMENTATION=====================
++++Choice of graphics system++++++++++
Option 1 : GGobi
Option 2 : iplots
       Easy to open several devices
       Trivial to link them
++++Data Structures for managing data projections+++++++++
++Atomic Data Structures++ (from R types)
1. set
	row.ids - vector
	type - string (one of c(false,fixed,target,unfixed))
++Derived Data Structures++ (from R types and Atomic Data Structures)
1. pair
	set1
	set2
		The type of at one and only one of (set1,set2) must be false
	type	string. Derives from the non false type of (set1,set2)
2. cpair
	Function that takes a pair and a data projection as arguments and returns a value

Operations on Projection Objects (these are atomic, so each object knows only about itself)
	 1-Create New (empty) projection object
	 2-Initialize object with status, id and projection
	 3-Return the projection object (to support copying)
	 4-
****It might be of concern that we do NOT track the ggobi display where this is displayed****
****We identify things by their id****
++++Widget Backend+++++++++++++
Implemented as a single closure
Shared Variables
       dataset
       List of projection matrices
       Empty Slots for new projection matrices
       ggobi object
       dataset projected onto each of the matrices (called a frame)
Functions
	make.frame
		Send a list of projection matrices
		Create a multicolumn data matrix (frame) from this (usable with ggobi / iplots)
	init.ggobi
		Add Open (empty) slots to this data
		Open GGobi with all plots
		Put all plots in brush mode
Operations on slots
	optimise.view
		Input is a view
		Compares to actual projection
		Performs a single step of iteration
